## Open Learning

### What is this repository for?

This repository is my Open Learning repository where I will openly share any learning I do related to technology and programming. I'll attempt to organise it by topic using folder and files so that anyone wishing to learn from the notes I take, resources I collate and websites I link out to will hopefully be able to do so easily. I'll also aim to update this **README** as this repository evolves.

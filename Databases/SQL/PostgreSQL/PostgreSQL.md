## PostgreSQL

Postgres is an open source relational database management system. 

### How to install Postgres

If performing a fresh installation on a Mac then run:

`brew install postgresql` or `brew install postgresql@vn` where vn represents a specific version number e.g. `brew install postgresql@14`

### Challenges of Postgres

* Writing efficient queries to retrieve information
* Designing the schema, or structure, of the database
* Understanding when to use advanced features
* Managing the database in a production environment

### Database Design Process

1. What kind of thing are we storing?
2. What properties does this thing have?
3. What type of data does each of those properties contain?

### What's in a Postgres Database?

Table - Collection of records
Columns - Each column records one property about a thing
Rows - Each row represents one record
